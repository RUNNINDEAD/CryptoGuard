# Cryptoguard

Cryptoguard is a versatile cryptography utility that provides various functions for encoding and decoding data. This application allows users to perform operations such as decrypting Base64 strings, comparing SHA256 and MD5 hashes, converting binary data to text, decrypting ROT13 encoded messages, decoding Morse code, and decrypting messages encoded with the Rail Fence Cipher.

## Features

- **Decrypt Base64**: Convert Base64 encoded strings back to their original text.
- **Compare SHA256 Hash**: Verify if a given string matches its SHA256 hash.
- **Compare MD5 Hash**: Verify if a given string matches its MD5 hash.
- **Convert Binary to Text**: Transform binary strings into readable text.
- **Decrypt ROT13**: Decode messages encoded with the ROT13 cipher.
- **Decrypt Morse Code**: Translate Morse code into plain text.
- **Decrypt Rail Fence Cipher**: Decode messages encoded using the Rail Fence Cipher method.
